# About
Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others.
People with developed emotional intelligence are able to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and interact with others, which helps improve the quality of interpersonal relationships. Understanding and managing emotions also helps people adapt to stressful situations, which are very common today. In today's society, the development of emotional intelligence is becoming a key element for successful communication and achievement of professional goals. A person with a high level of emotional intelligence can find constructive ways out of difficulties while maintaining mental balance and psychological stability. Efforts invested in the development of this area can improve the quality of life and contribute to overall self-improvement. The developed application helps to determine the level of one's own emotional intelligence, promotes control over one's own emotional state and helps to develop skills for developing emotional intelligence. The application uses SwiftUI to create a user interface. Declarative syntax is used to make the code more readable and concise. Supporting emotional intelligence is an investment in our future. It will help us live happier, more successful, and more fulfilling lives.
